# Remote leds project
#### Control leds by mobile app or by voice commands :rotating_light:

## General info
Project for using mobile app and speech recognition to control, in this case, led diodes (but it might be whatever - oven temperature, garage door, etc...).

This repo contains source code for Arduino, server and speech recognition functionalities.

If you want to know more about mobile app contact me via Kremienowski33@gmail.com.

Python 3.6 recommended, but works fine on 3.9.
